# Purchase Amount Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the Purchase Amount for a retail company using machine learning models, specifically Linear Regression and RandomForestRegressor. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **Notebooks:**
  - `Linear_Regression_Model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the Linear Regression model for Purchase Amount prediction.
  - `Random_Forest_Model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the RandomForestRegressor model for Purchase Amount prediction.

- **Data:**
  - `dataset.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the models.

- **Scripts:**
  - `data_preprocessing.py`: Python script for data preprocessing steps.
  - `model_evaluation.py`: Python script for evaluating model performance.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/purchase-amount-prediction.git
